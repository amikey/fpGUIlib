Hello.
Here demo of fpGUI library used by Java.
For Linux 64 bit and Windows 32 bit.

-In terminal do:

-> cd /fpGUIlib_Java (-> go in demo path)

-> java -Djava.library.path=. fpg

This all. :-)

PS: Java.exe is added in demo package in case of Windows-path-problems. :-)
If your system has already path-to-Java.exe defined, just delete Java.exe of demo.
